# DemoUniverstiyOOPJava
UCF Object Oriented coding project in Java of an example University Spring 2021

Coding is project-specific in Java using Object Oriented programming, with requirements set by the instructor, Professor Boustique.
Specific coding designed to show use of classes, hierarchies, abstract classes, file output (input is similar), with exception handling.
The topic is a hypothetical University with Faculty, Students, and Employees.  These segments are basic and not intended to be
true representations of an actual University, but rather intended to show the range of object-oriented design that is used for
such programming.  I programmed the entire project on my own, primarily due to Covid19 with limited other student interaction.
These concepts however, apply in a team programming situation.

Please note that Git still uses the master branch name.  You will see the project code by switching over to that branch on this repository.
